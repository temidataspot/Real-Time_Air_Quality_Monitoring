# Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring

# Project Overview

In this project, I analyze real-time air quality data by querying an API, importing the data into SQL for storage, and using R 
for data cleaning and analysis. Predictive modeling will be done in R to forecast air quality trends. Finally, I built dynamic 
visualizations in Tableau to showcase real-time and historical air quality trends across multiple cities.
