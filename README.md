# Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring

# Project Overview

In this project, I analyze real-time air quality data by querying an API, importing the data into SQL for storage, and using R 
for data cleaning and analysis. Predictive modeling was done in R to forecast air quality trends. Finally, I built dynamic 
visualizations in Tableau to showcase real-time and historical air quality trends across multiple cities.

# This project involved five major steps:
- API Query for Real-Time Air Quality Data
- Import Data into SQL
- Data Cleaning and Analysis in R
- Forecasting Air Quality in R
- Visualization in Tableau
