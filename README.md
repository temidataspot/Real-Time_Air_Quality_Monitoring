# Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring

# Project Overview

In this project, I analyze real-time air quality data by querying an API, importing the data into SQL for storage, and using R 
for data cleaning and analysis. Predictive modeling was done in R to forecast air quality trends. Finally, I built dynamic 
visualizations in Tableau to showcase real-time and historical air quality trends across multiple cities.

# This project involved five major steps:
- [API Query for Real-Time Air Quality Data](https://github.com/temidataspot/Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring/blob/main/API%20Query%20%5BPython%5D.md)
- [Import Data into SQL](https://github.com/temidataspot/Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring/blob/main/%5BSQL%5D%20Importing%20Data%20and%20Storage.md)
- [Data Cleaning and Analysis in R](https://github.com/temidataspot/Real-Time_Air_Quality_Monitoring/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Analysis%20in%20R.md)
- Forecasting Air Quality in R
- Visualization in Tableau
